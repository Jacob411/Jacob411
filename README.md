# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Jacob Simmons**, a passionate Software Engineer studying at **Auburn University**. Most of my work has involved using **machine learning, data science, and software development** to solve real-world problems. This GitHub profile serves as a showcase of my projects and contributions in these fields.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working part-time as Engineer focusing on **Computer Vision**, ML tasks, and building **high-throughput pipelines**.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m diving deep into **AI/ML**, **evolutionary algorithms**, **Neovim Plugins**, **NLP**, and **large language models (LLMs)**.  
- ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m passionate about **building tools**, **optimizing workflows**, and leveraging **automation** to improve productivity.

- Checkout **Atlas Study** - A project me and friend are working on to provide new study tools for students - [atlas-knowledge.vercel.app](https://atlas-knowledge.vercel.app)

## Projects

Here are some of the recent projects you'll find in this repository:

- [Ollama Copilot](https://github.com/Jacob411/Ollama-Copilot): A **Neovim plugin** that integrates locally hosted LLMs provided by Ollama to deliver GitHub Copilot-like autocompletions.  
- [MMLab-pose](https://github.com/Jacob411/mmlab-pose): Tooling for getting started with **pose estimation Vision Transformers** from [ViTPose](https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/ViTPose).  
- [Playlist Image Generator](https://github.com/Jacob411/PlaylistImageGenerator): Generate AI-powered playlist cover art using **Dalle-3** based on playlist genres.  
- [Crypto-Manager](https://github.com/Jacob411/Crypto-Manager): A **file encryption and decryption** command-line tool written entirely in C++.  
- **OSP Chatbot**: Part of my senior design project, a chatbot leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to assist Auburn University's Office of Sponsored Programs with document retrieval and Q&A tasks.  

Feel free to explore the projects, check out the code, and provide feedback or suggestions. I'm always open to collaboration!

## Recent Highlights
  
- Built **data preprocessing pipelines** for **Re-Identification** and **object detection models**.  
- Currently working on **evolutionary algorithms** and tackling competetive programming problems to sharpen algorithmic skills.  
- Exploring **NLP pipelines** and integrating LLMs into interactive tools.
